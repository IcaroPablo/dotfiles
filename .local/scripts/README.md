# Shell Script Collection
My collection of useful shellscripts (and my dotfiles)

## About this repo
- All my dotfiles are inside the [dotfiles](/dotfiles) folder
- The shell scripts are placed at the root directory because I consider them few, hence, they don't need to be separated in folders yet

>_Note: this is still a work in progress, I'm still a newb_
