# Icaro's dotfiles

Small set (hopefully) of dotfiles I keep for dealing with my basic *nix needs

## Dot script

These dotfiles are managed using the [git bare repo method](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) though a small shellscript called "[dot](.local/scripts/dot)" for ease of use.

## OpenBSD install guide

Although these are general purpose dotfiles, they are primarily focused on my OpenBSD desktop setups
